## Random codes to do things and such:

### - MultiTaskRNN.py: A versatile LSTM/RNN originally written for simultaneous prediction in two related NLP tasks. Includes capabilities for Bayesian/VI optimization (adaptive weight noise per Graves 2011), embedding layer, convolutional layer, shared recurrent layers, independent/laterally connected task-specific ReLU layers, an auxiliary task for explicit manipulation of internal representation (low level supervision per Sogaard 2016) and more.


### - Tensorflow_CNN.ipynb: A straightforward ConvNet written in Tensorflow.
